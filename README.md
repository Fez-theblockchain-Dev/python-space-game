🛸 Space Invaders

🎮 Introduction
Space Invaders is a modern take on the classic retro arcade shooter, built using Python and Pygame. This project demonstrates object-oriented design principles, game development fundamentals, and a foundational understanding of rendering, event handling, and sprite-based animation.

Designed as a showcase project for a Junior Python Developer, it also introduces a basic game economy, including gold coin collection through gameplay and an in-progress integration of in-app purchases via Apple Pay.

📜 Table of Contents

Installation:

Prerequisites - Python 3.8+ and Pygame are required for the game client.

Steps:

1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Fez-theblockchain-Dev/python-space-game
cd python-space-game

2.(Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

3.Install the game dependency (Pygame):
pip install pygame


4.Run the game:
python game/main.py

5.Backend API dependencies - Install the backend API required software to get full bemefits of the game, such as, in-progress shop/payment features, install backend dependencies from the API folder:

pip install -r backend_apis/requirements.txt

Usage:
Movement - Arrow keys move the ship.

Shoot - Spacebar fires lasers.

Game includes a main menu and themed backgrounds handled by the menu system.

Features:
Object-oriented design with dedicated classes for player, enemies, lasers, and obstacles.

In-game currency system (gold coins).

Planned Apple Pay integration for purchases (in progress).

Interactive main menu, sound, sprites, and increasing difficulty mechanics.

Project Structure:
game/main.py — main game loop and runtime setup.

game/config.py — game settings and constants (screen size, economy values).

game/mainMenu.py — menu rendering and theme management.

assets/ — image and font assets loaded by the game (backgrounds, fonts, ship sprite).

audio/ — sound effects (laser sound loaded by the player class).

backend_apis/ — backend services and economy integration.

Demo:
- Space Invaders Shop screen recording: [https://share.icloud.com/photos/04aff3DEOm7JH6AvxIznxHbeA]

Dependencies:
Game Client

Python 3.8+

Pygame

Backend API

FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Requests, Pydantic (for the backend server)


Configuration:
-Gameplay and economy constants (screen size, coin rates, rewards) live in game/config.py.

-The backend API base URL is configurable via the GAME_BACKEND_URL environment variable (defaults to http://localhost:8000).

Troubleshooting:
-Ensure Python and Pygame are installed correctly.
-If the game window doesn’t launch, check display drivers or reinstall Pygame.
-Audio warnings can appear if sound files are missing or fail to load (the game will continue).
-In-app purchases are a work in progress and may be disabled.
